# Predicting the Valence of a Scene from Observers' Eye Movements

Objective
------------
The paper 'Prediction of valence scene from observer's' eye movements' is taken and studied and the accuracy is improved greatly compared to that of original paper.


Minimum Requirements
---------------------
python3


Packages Needed
-----------------
1) pandas
2) scipy
3) numpy
4) scikit_learn


Machine Learning Models used
-----------------------------
In the view of increasing the accuracy of our prediction, this paper trains the data with three famous classifiers and takes a hard-voting ensemble of all the classifiers.

The three classifiers used for training the data are as follows.
1) Linear SVM Kernel Classifier
2) K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
3) Extra Trees Classifier


Results
-----------
The orginal paper reported an accuracy of 49% whereas an accuracy of 72.41% could be observed in this project which is very great compared to that of original paper.
